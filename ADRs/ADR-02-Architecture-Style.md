# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR-02: Architecture style

### Status:

ACCEPTED

### Context:

The choice of architectural style is crucial to the success of a software project, as the key driving characteristics are used to shape the architectural decisions made throughout the design process. 

Though the identification of architecture characteristics is one of the first steps in the architecture design process, it can evolve in an iterative process throughout the design phase where the driving architectural characteristics will influence the design of the system, and as the system design takes shape and aims to reflect the driving architectural characteristics, learnings and decisions made throughout the process can in turn influence the driving architectural characteristics.

It's important to select a style that fits the problem domain, as changing it during implementation can be costly. Consistent implementation of the architecture also enhances the systemâ€™s clarity and understanding.

Depending on the style, additional decisions like databases, communication patterns, ... can be derived.

### Decision:

According to the requirements and the [Architecture Characteristics](../Architecture%20Characteristics/architecture-characteristics.md) we decided to use the Service Based Architecture to better support testability, maintainability, feasibility (simplicity, and cost effectiveness). 

This compliments the existing architecture as it too follows an event-based architecture style. This allows us to integrate our additional components into existing components and databases thereby reducing complexity, and taking advantage of the existing driving architectures of the current system.

### Consequences:

- Service-Based Architecture is comparatively cheaper and faster to build and easier to maintain.
- Additional components can integrate with existing components and databases.
- The option remains to evolve the architecture through decomposition of existing components based on need derived from observing system behaviour and meeting future needs.

### Strengthened characteristics:
- Cost (relatively straight forward to implement).
- Maintainability (easy to add new services with new functionality).
- Testability (independent services with clear interfaces).

### Weakened characteristics
- Elasticity (due to shared databases between services).
