## Best Practices

We will adhere to best practices in AI Architecture Design ensuring we include Guardrails and Evals where appropriate:

- **Modular Design:**

Structure the system into distinct, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.
This will enhance flexibility, allows for easier updates, and improve collaboration. For example, separate modules for data preprocessing, model training, and model inference.

 - **Scalability:**

Design a system that can handle increased loads and expanded datasets without significant rewrites.
This will facilitate the growth of the system in response to higher data volumes or more users.

- **Data Management:**

Implement a robust data pipeline for data ingestion, preprocessing, and storage. Ensure data quality and governance practices are in place.
Streamlineing data access and ensuring that high-quality data is used for model training, improving model accuracy.

- **Model Lifecycle Management:**

Adopting practices for versioning, testing, and deploying AI models (e.g., CI/CD for models).
This will ensure reproducibility, facilitating rollback to previous versions, and maintaining performance over time. Tools like MLflow or Kubeflow can be used for model lifecycle management.

- **Monitoring and Evaluation:**

Setting up monitoring systems to track model performance, data drift, and anomalies after deployment.
This will help to maintain the performance of models over time and allows for timely interventions when models begin to degrade.

- **Explainability and Transparency:**

Designing systems to provide insights into how AI models make decisions (e.g., using LIME, SHAP).
This will build trust among stakeholders and aids in compliance with regulations such as GDPR, which requires explainability in AI systems.

- **Ethical Considerations:**

Incorporating ethical guidelines into the design process to address biases, fairness, and accountability in AI.
This will foster responsible AI development and use, reducing the risk of harm to individuals or groups.

- **Feedback Loops:**

Design systems to incorporate feedback from users or performance metrics to continuously improve models.
This will facilitate ongoing refinement of models and alignment with user needs.
   
## Event Storming

We used [Event Storming](/Event%20Storming/event-storming.md) to explore and map out various domains within our business
processes. The session focused on capturing and documenting the flow of events, actors, and interactions between
systems. This document summarizes our outcomes and serves as a guide to understanding our approach.

## Architecture Characteristics
We chose the following as our top 3 [architectural characteristics](./Architecture%20Characteristics/architecture-characteristics.md):

![Architecture Characteristics](/Architecture%20Characteristics/architecture-characteristics.png)

- accuracy
- reliability
- scalability

## Architecture Style

According to the TOP 3 driving characteristics and TOP 2 implicit characteristics*:

- cost (feasability)*
- maintainability*
- testability (reliability)
- simplicity (feasability)*
- scalability
- fault-tolerance (reliability)

a service-based architecture was selected to leverage the optimal balance between the driving architecture characteristics: testability, fault-tolerance, scalability; and implicit architectural characteristics: feasibility (cost/time) and maintainability.

![Architecture Style](./ADRs/images/ADR-02-architecture-style.png)

## Architecture

By utilizing the [C4](https://c4model.com/) approach to visualize software architecture, we were able to depict 
the dependencies among different components of our application while highlighting their relationships. We 
will primarily concentrate on the C2 views to present an overarching overview, followed by a deeper exploration 
of the core components in the C3 view later in the process.

## Known Limitations

The current architecture has the following limitations:
  - In the future we could implement an AI agent that utilizes machine learning algorithms to monitor candidates during assessments, analyse behavioral patterns, and identify anomalies that may indicate cheating but we decided against this for MVP as outlined in [ADR-10 AI Agent to monitor candidates for cheating](/ADRs/ADR-10-AI-Agent-to-monitor-candidates-for-cheating.md)

## Usage of GenAI

This repository contains content that was partially generated using Generative AI technologies. We have utilized these tools to assist in the creation and enhancement of certain aspects of the project. However, please note that all AI-generated content has been carefully reviewed and edited by our team to ensure accuracy, quality, and relevance before being included in the project.
