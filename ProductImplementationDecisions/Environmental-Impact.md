## Environmental Impact

### Status
- ACCEPTED

### Context
The introduction of AI into our solutions increases the necessity to focus on our Environmental Impact. As our operations scale, it becomes essential to consider the environmental implications of data storage, processing, and model training. By implementing strategies to minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions, leveraging efficient algorithms, and adopting sustainable practices, we can significantly reduce our environmental footprint.

### Decision
Incorporate a sustainability impact metric as part of our company Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure and drive our commitment to reducing our environmental impact. This metric will track energy consumption, carbon emissions, and other relevant sustainability parameters associated with our AI operations and infrastructure.

Review and enable migration to more effecient models as they become available.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Do Not Include a Sustainability Metric**:
   - This option was considered but rejected as it would neglect our responsibility to monitor and manage our environmental impact, especially as we leverage AI technologies that could exacerbate energy consumption.

2. **Focus Solely on Cost Efficiency**:
   - While cost efficiency is important, prioritizing this over sustainability would not align with our long-term goals of corporate social responsibility and could harm our reputation among environmentally conscious clients and partners.

3. **Outsource Sustainability Measurement**:
   - The consideration to outsource sustainability measurement was dismissed as it may lead to a lack of ownership and accountability within the organization regarding our environmental goals.
