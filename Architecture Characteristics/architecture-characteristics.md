# Architecture Characteristics

Architecture characteristics, often referred to as quality attributes (ilities) or non-functional requirements, define the properties of an architecture to meet the technical and business goals.

## Define needed characteristics

Starting from the business requirements the following important characteristics were deemed as relevant for the SoftArchCert product:

| **Term**             | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Choosing the driving characteristics

Key characteristics prioritized:

Accuracy of the certification process is vital for the success of the company, and critical to ensure candidates do not suffer job loss or career damage due to inaccuracy.

- **Testability**: Robust regression tests are needed for non-deterministic AI systems to ensure quality and accuracy.
- **Data Integrity**: Data generated by AI systems if not correct and without data loss would be detrimental to the certification process and credibility of the company.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Product stability and partial functional availability in the system in the event of partial failure strengthens the company's credibility as a certification process that can be relied upon.
- **Auditability**: AI systems processes and results can be reviewed and verified for accuracy, compliance, and security. It is critical to the reputation of the company to be able to stand over automatic grading results, and reassure candidates with appropriate human-in-the-loop interventions.
- **Sustainability**: Workloads, especially AI workloads, use the least amount of energy, cooling, embodied carbon, and carbon emissions possible while serving customer needs.

## Selecting the Top 3 Driving Architecture Characteristics

During the requirements gathering process and the [EventStorming](../Event%20Storming/event-storming.md) session, we identified four main challenges:

- We need to carefully balance cost, accuracy, and SLAs whilst meeting projected scaling targets, potential certification path expansion, and maintain market dominance without having to scale personell linearly with demand.
- GenAI is non-deterministic, so we need a way to continually test, monitor, and calibrate the accuracy of the automatic graders and test generators, along with appropriate human-in-the-loop capabilities.
- We need to be able to satisfactorily explain the process of how the automatic graders determined their score and provided feedback for the purposes of optimisation, and potential external litigation.
- To keep SoftArchCert's continuing competitive advantage we need to ensure the solution can continuously evolve to meet tighter SLAs and customer demands whilst maintaining accuracy and reliability.

We started out focusing on Cost and Scalability, which led us to do analysis of LLM costing models and grading SLAs. We learnt that the cost of the solution would be nowhere near as expensive as the cost of the expert architects, and scaling is less of a concern when you have long SLAs and not huge volumes of processing.

That led us to focus on the critical concerns of the business namely:

> **Critical Information**
> * As a recognized leader in certification, accuracy of tests, case studies, and grading is job and. Inaccurate grading can result in a candidate not getting or maintaining a job and can impact a candidate's career.
> * Inaccurate or misleading certification exams and case studies can undermine the credibility of the company’s current standing in the marketplace, so accuracy of the certification process is vital for the success of the company.

These challenges led us to conclude that _Testability_, _Data Integrity_, and _Fault Tolerance_ as the top three driving factors for this solution:

### Testability

- Inaccurate grading can result in a candidate not getting or maintaining a job and can impact a candidate's career.
- Inaccurate or misleading certification exams and case studies can undermine the credibility of the company’s current standing in the marketplace, so accuracy of the certification process is vital for the success of the company.
- Robust regression tests are needed for non-deterministic AI systems to ensure quality due to model degradation, model changes, and changes in source material loaded into the vector database to facilitate the RAG pattern.
- Continuous calibration of the results from AI processes against a small sample of equivalent manual processing ensures accuracy remains high.

### Data Integrity

- As a recognized leader in certification, accuracy of tests, case studies, and grading inaccurate grading can result in a candidate not getting or maintaining a job and can impact a candidate's career,
- Tests must provide a sufficient level of coverage and completeness to maintain the high levels of accuracy needed to maintain credibility in the marketplace.
- Robust regression tests are needed for non-deterministic AI systems to ensure quality and accuracy.
- Regression testing is very important where the changes to the source material against which exam submissions are graded, or examination question sets, or the underlying LLM models could effect the quality and accuracy of the certification process.

### Fault Tolerance

- As a recognized leader in certification, accuracy of tests, case studies, and grading inaccurate grading can result in a candidate not getting or maintaining a job and can impact a candidate's career,
- Tests must provide a sufficient level of coverage and completeness to maintain the high levels of accuracy needed to maintain credibility in the marketplace.
- Robust regression tests are needed for non-deterministic AI systems to ensure quality and accuracy.
- Regression testing is very important where the changes to the source material against which exam submissions are graded, or examination question sets, or the underlying LLM models could effect the quality and accuracy of the certification process.

## Selecting the Top 2 Implicit Architecture Characteristics

### Feasability (cost/time)

- Certifiable, Inc. has heard that the use of AI can be somewhat costly and are concerned about significant cost overruns by introducing AI into their certification process. However, while cost is certainly a factor, given that this initiative is a strategic one, they are willing to be somewhat flexible.
- It is important to closely analyse costs and time-to-market in appyling AI functionality to the solution and determine feasibility to justify ROI, and to quickly take advantage of opportunities to expand in the marketplace.
- Balancing cost, accuracy, and SLAs from a technical perspective opens up business opportunities to improve each over time.
- As AI and AI adoption is critical to the continued success of businesses in the future it is important to grow skills in working with, and creating AI systems within the organisation.
- A low cost GenAI model will provide basic inferencing capabilities with the expert software architecture knowledge relevant to queries being supplied by the RAG pattern.
- AWS Bedrock inference batching allows us to spread queries out over time, while still meeting SLAs, and allows us to avail of 50% lower price compared to on-demand inference pricing using AWS Bedrock.
- To future-proof the SoftArchCert system, we aim to ensure the interchangeability of GenAI models so we can continue to leverage advancements in performance, speed, accuracy, and cost to improve SLAs and customer satisfaction.

### Maintainability

- It is important that we are able to respond quickly to changes in order to optimise cost, accuracy, and SLAs over time.
- Changes to examination material may trigger a reduction in accuracy and quick response to this is essential.
- Quickly responding to new AI models, AI technology enhancements and capabilities is important to maintain competitve dominance.
